# Marlians! 🤸🏽‍♂️🙅🏽‍♂️
To keep morale high, this site plays popular chants at intervals.

# Contribute?
This would be more fun with other people adding their own sounds.
1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your sound in `/sounds` with an easy-to-understand name.
3. Add the name of the sound file to the queue in `js/app.js`.
4. Commit your changes and create a pull request.

## How to prepare sounds (iMessage)
These steps start with iMessage, but any other method works from step 3, as long as you can
upload the file to the audio tuner site.
1. Receive the sound in a chat.
2. Using a laptop, right-click the message in the chat and click "show in finder".
3. Convert the caf file to m4a using [this site](https://cloudconvert.com/caf-to-m4a).
4. Use this [audio trimmer site](https://audiotrimmer.com/) to trim the audio to only the time the person was talking.
5. Remove background noise from the sound using [this site](https://audiodenoise.com/).
6. Save the audio as an m4a. You can convert it if you need to.
7. Add it to this repo and send in a PR!
